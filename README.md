A simple code which calculates the OP descriptor from a depth image.
The image is first converted to a Point Cloud, uisng the calibration parameters for
the MSR3D dataset.

% the R and H parameters of the code are given for the MSR3D dataset also. All the other parameters can be adjusted and are independent on the depth image provided.
